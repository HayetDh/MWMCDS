Solving the minimum weight minimum connected dominating set (MWMCDS) problem that
 aims to minimize the size and the total weight of the connected dominating set.

                        =========================

The repository contains the executable version of the algorithm proposed in
 "A local search algorithm based on non-dominated sorting for minimum weight
 minimum connected dominating set problem", and the two datasets that were used.

In these datasets, each instance consists of an undirected connected graph with n
vertices and m edges.
In dataset2, the number of edges m is varied for each vertex count n.
For a specific number of nodes and edges, 10 instances exist for most graphs and they
are referred by s (s changes from 1 to 10).

The code is written in c++ language.
